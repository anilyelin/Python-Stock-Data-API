# Python-Stock-Data-API
Basic python **program with GUI** to retrieve stock data using an API


To get this program *working* you have to get an *API key* <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key">here</a>

You can retrieve all the relevant stock data from all *NASDAQ* listed companies and output the graph of the day close price. There is also the ability to store the day close data from a specific company into a sqlite3 file. 

However this program is only tested on **Mac OS Sierra with pyhton3.6.**
